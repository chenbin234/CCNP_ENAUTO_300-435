| Q16 OpenConfig and native YANG data models | **Open Models** – Designed to be independent of the underlying platform and normalize the per-vendor configuration of network devices. Open YANG Models are developed by Vendors and Standards bodies, such as IETF, ITU, OpenConfig etc.<br />**Native Models** – Native Models are developed by the vendors. They relate and are designed to integrate to features or configuration only relevant to that platform. |            |

| Q19 update the SNMP community              | The type of SNMP access. Can be one of 'none' (disabled), 'community' (V1/V2c), or 'users' (V3). |            |
| Q20 NETCONF                                | - Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys. <br />- Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration data (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only). <br />- Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!" means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list. | 3          |
| Q22 NETCONF vs. RESTCONF                   | RESTCONF is a subset of NETCONF, so not all operations are supported, for example candidate configurations. |            |
| Q23 OpenConfig vs. Yang                    | When creating an on-change subscription, the dampening period must be set to 0 to indicate that there is no dampening period; no other value is supported. |            |
| Q25/Q26 tree                               | - everything ending with * is a list. Lists with a type are leaf-lists. So where interface* [name] is a list, higher-layer-if and lower-layer-if are leaf-lists. | 3          |
